          What is the HaaS?
	  </h3>
	  <p>
            We're developing <a href="https://github.com/CCI-MOC">Hardware as
            a Service</a> to be a new fundamental layer in cloud datacenters.
            In a HaaS-enabled datacenter, researchers and developers can
            independently stand up services on bare hardware, with guaranteed
            isolation between them.  They can scale their deployments by
            allocating and freeing hardware nodes, without having to change
            any physical setup of the datacenter.
          </p>

        <h3><a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span
          class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
          Why do we need Recursive HaaS?
	  </h3>

	  <p>
            After allocating new nodes, software must be deployed onto them.
	    Currently, the best deployment options we have involve PXE-booting
	    the nodes into an install image---even just the BIOS POST, the
	    first part of this process, can take minutes.  A faster deployment
	    method is key to users scaling their application up more rapidly.
          </p>

	  <p>
	    While it is not acceptable for a general environment, users
	  that have some level of trust with each other could use
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec</a> to
	  move from a running Linux kernel to a pre-boot environment without
	  going through a full hardware reboot.  As long as different
	  users of the HaaS agree to leave machines in a state
	  that is ready to kexec, then this could be used to quickly
	  deploy to machines allocated with the HaaS.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than complicating the existing HaaS layer to do this, we
	    envision implementing what we call Recursive HaaS.  Users could
	    run HaaS as a service, on top of the datacenter's base HaaS: the
	    derived HaaS's nodes would be allocated from base HaaS's nodes,
	    the derived HaaS's networks would be set up by the base HaaS, and
	    so forth.  But users of the derived HaaS would have an agreement
	    with each other that users of the base HaaS do not have: When
	    freeing nodes, they will be left in a state ready to be kexec'd.
	    This allows users of the derived HaaS to scale up their
	    deployments much more quickly.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Fast provisioning is just an example of recursive HaaS.
	  There are a number of interesting research projects that we
	  see a recursive HaaS implementation enabling.

          Possible Goals
        </h3>
	  <p>
          <ul>
	    <li> Develop a simple pass-through recursive HaaS
          implementation.
	    <li> Add kexec support, and build a pre-boot environment
          that can be provisioned against.  For the pre-boot environment:
              <ul>
                <li> Research existing pre-boot environments
                <li> Try different policies for entering the pre-boot
                environment (whether the user or the HaaS does this; what kind
                of checking is done by the HaaS or a HaaS administrator)
                <li> Find a way to communicate the new OS to the pre-boot
                environment
                <li> Perhaps investigate broadcast communication methods, to
                speed up provisioning many nodes at once
                <li> Could the pre-boot environment be skipped?  Perhaps kexec
                directly from the old OS to the new
              </ul>
	    <li> Demonstrate a piece of software scaling up through kexec
	    <li> Measure performance of the kexec method, compared to a cold boot
	    <li> Characterize level of trust needed between users---potentially
	    even prototype some possible attacks
            <li> Investigate allocating additional nodes to the derived HaaS
            on demand
	    <li> Study alternatives to kexec
          </ul> </p>
