          Project Description
	</h3>

	  <p>
            Openstack services, such as Nova, Cinder, and Swift, are run by a
            resource provider (the group running and maintaining the Openstack
            installation), and used by a resource consumer (tenants in the
            Openstack installation).  There is only two different economic
            roles in this system: the buyer and the seller.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more complex systems, organizations may want to act as
            resellers: buying a resource, somehow repackaging it conveniently,
            and then selling it again.  In an Openstack environment, this can
            be accomplished by running an Openstack service which itself gets
            its resources from other Openstack services.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this project we will demonstrate one particular version of
            this: per-tenant pass-through openstack services.  When you create
            or allocate an object in one of these services, it will pass the
            request to an underlying service, thereby creating or allocating
            the object there.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some use-cases are as follows.  One-to-one mapping: pass through
            directly to underlying services.  Many-to-one mapping: pass
            through to one of several different underlying services.
          </p>

          <p>
          For this to be convenient, there should be a way to deploy these
          pass-through services in an automated fashion, possibly using Heat.
          </p>

          Possible Goals
        </h3>
	  <p>
          <ul>
	    <li> Write a pass-through implementation for some of the Openstack
	      services (most likely Nova)
              <ul>
                <li> Decide how to manage authorization and
                authentication---use the underlying layer's identity services,
                  or build new ones
                <li> One-to-one or many-to-one?
                <li> In the many-to-one situation, does there need to be
                metadata for which underlying service to go to?  Do Openstack
                APIs need to be modified?
              </ul>
            <li> Automated deployment of pass-through services
          </ul> </p>
